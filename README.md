In March 2023, Silicon Valley Bank experienced a collapse and seizure by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI). The collapse was triggered by a bank run on its deposits, which was caused by central bank-endorsed interest rate hikes and concerns about the bank's liquidity. The DFPI appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) as the receiver of the bank. The FDIC established a bridge bank successor called Silicon Valley Bridge Bank, which assumed ongoing business operations. First Citizens Bank & Trust Company later acquired the commercial banking business of Silicon Valley Bridge Bank from the FDIC.
